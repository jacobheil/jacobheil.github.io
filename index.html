			plane and there was a small landing field beside the lake. <br />During the summer
			months, Lone Pine was gay with strangers <br />--swimming, dancing, putting on shows.
			They had turned the <br />ballroom into a theater. When not in use, folding chairs
			<br />were lined in rows against the walls. At one end was a tiny <br />and exquisitely
			conceived stage and a modest equipment of <br />back drops and wings hung from the
			ceiling. A tier of three <br />red velvet steps led from the small auditorium to the
			stage. <br />It was beautiful there in the summer evenings when the long <br />French
			windows were flung open to the live and fragrant <br />air and the only illumination
			upon the audience was the blue <br />moonlight flooding room. On the small lighted stage
			<br />the colorful performances and voices of the actors mingled <br />with the secret
			nocturnal dramas of the night outside.</p><p>Although they spent only their summers here
			they <br />leased the house the year round. But now alı the furniture <br />was draped
			in white sheets and only the huge fireplace in <br />the oak paneled wall of the living
			room was bared to sight. <br />The great house, its windows shuttered tight, was silent
			<br />and desolate all winter long.</p><p>Philip did not miss his former spacious

			<br />seemed to him the only home he had ever known. Its cold <br />rooms were dingy,
			its uneven floors--painted an ugly tan-- <br />were scuffed and chipped, and Philip on a
			<br />decrepit couch in the living room. None of these things annoyed <br />the once
			fastidious Philip. He desired nothing more.</p><p>Sometimes he would get his mandolin

			small television set had been given him for Christmas <br />but he couldn't work up any
